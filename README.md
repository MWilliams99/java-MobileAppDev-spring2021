# Java WGU Mobile Application Development Spring 2021

## Project Description
Mobile Application Development project that I completed in Spring 2021 for the C196 course at Western Governors University.  
Every student is given the same set of requirements for this project, which can be found [here]().  
This program fulfills parts A-C of the project requirements.

This project was completed on March 28th, 2021.

Java was used to code this project as that is what I chose to focus in during my Software Development degree. ... used for the database element/storage of items.  
.. was used for ...

This project has the student create an Android mobile application for the user to schedule terms, courses, and assessments. When the application is opened the user is met with a homescreen that links to a term list.  
The term list allows the user to add terms. Upon clicking on a specific term, the user can edit the term details and navigate to a course list for that term.  
Similar to the term list, the course list allows the user to add courses to the term. Clicking on a specific course allows the user to edit the course details and navigate to an assessment list associated with that course.  
Once again, similar to the previous lists, the assessment list allows the user to add new assessments or select a specific assessment to edit the details.

Menu options for all three edit views of term, course, and assessment allow the user to delete the selected object. For courses and assessments, the user can also set alerts for the start and end dates of the course or assessment. These alerts will appear even if the application is closed. Courses also have the option to share the notes section of the course details via email or sms.

## Design Process
Section B of the project requirements specify 7 layouts to use throughout the application. However, how these are designed exactly are left to interpretation. 
The storyboard for section D of the project requirements, outlining the layouts and application flow for the program can be found [here]().

## Acknowledgements 
This project is included as part of my portfolio to showcase the skills learned throughout my time at WGU.  
This is not meant for any other student to directly copy. However, if looking through the way I coded and solved the project requirements helps understand possible ways to complete the project yourself, then I am glad to help.
